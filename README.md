Of course. Here is a comprehensive `README.md` for a project named `fbscript` that aims to integrate FreeBASIC with GDScript (Godot's scripting language).

This README is structured to be professional and useful, assuming the project's goal is to allow Godot to call high-performance code written in FreeBASIC. It includes placeholders for badges, a clear project structure, build instructions, and code examples.

### Bridging the gap between FreeBASIC and GDScript

[![FreeBASIC](https://img.shields.io/badge/FreeBASIC-1.10.0-blue.svg)](https://www.freebasic.net/)
[![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-4.x-blueviolet.svg)](https://godotengine.org/)

**fbscript** is a project template and library demonstrating how to harness the raw performance and low-level capabilities of the compiled **FreeBASIC** language directly within your **Godot 4.x** game projects.

By leveraging Godot's **GDExtension** system, you can write performance-critical logic (like complex calculations, algorithms, or data processing) in FreeBASIC, compile it into a shared library, and call it seamlessly from GDScript as if it were a native Godot class.

*(Note: "GodScript" is assumed to be an informal name for GDScript, the primary scripting language for the Godot Engine.)*

## Key Features

-   **Performance Boost:** Offload heavy computations from interpreted GDScript to a fast, compiled FreeBASIC library.
-   **Low-Level Access:** Utilize pointers, custom memory management, and other features of FreeBASIC.
-   **Seamless Integration:** Call your FreeBASIC functions and methods directly from GDScript.
-   **Cross-Platform:** The template includes build scripts for Windows and Linux.
-   **Simple Workflow:** A clear and straightforward process to compile your FreeBASIC code and use it in Godot.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **FreeBASIC Compiler (fbc):** [Download FreeBASIC](https://www.freebasic.net/get) (v1.07 or newer recommended).
2.  **Godot Engine:** [Download Godot](https://godotengine.org/download) (v4.0 or newer is required for GDExtension).
3.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.

## Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to get a simple example running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/fbscript.git
cd fbscript
```

### 2. Write Your FreeBASIC Code

Open `src/fb_library.bas`. This file contains the core logic you want to expose to Godot. For this example, we have a simple function that adds two numbers.

The key is to use `Export` and `Alias` to create a C-compatible function name that GDExtension can find.

**`src/fb_library.bas`**
```freebasic
'' fb_library.bas
''
'' All functions exposed to Godot must be declared with `Export`.
'' The `Alias` is the C-style name that Godot's GDExtension will look for.
'' We use `Extern "C"` to ensure a C-style calling convention.

Extern "C"

  ' A simple function to add two integers.
  ' It will be available in Godot as `add_integers`.
  Function add_integers(a As Integer, b As Integer) As Integer Export Alias "fb_add_integers"
    Return a + b
  End Function


  ' A function to demonstrate string manipulation (or just returning a string).
  ' NOTE: Proper string handling between languages requires careful memory management.
  ' This simple example is for demonstration only. A robust solution would use
  ' Godot's string types via the GDExtension API.
  Function get_hello_message() As ZString Ptr Export Alias "fb_get_hello_message"
    ' Static ensures the string data persists after the function returns.
    Static message As ZString * 20 = "Hello from FB!"
    Return @message
  End Function

End Extern
```

### 3. Compile the FreeBASIC Library

Run the build script for your operating system. This will compile `fb_library.bas` into a shared library (`.dll` on Windows, `.so` on Linux) and place it in the `godot_project/bin/` directory.

**On Windows:**
```bash
build.bat
```

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

These scripts simply call the FreeBASIC compiler (`fbc`):
`fbc -lib -w all -dll src/fb_library.bas -x godot_project/bin/libfbscript`

### 4. Set Up the Godot Project

The `godot_project/` folder is a ready-to-use Godot project. The magic happens in the `fbscript.gdextension` file. This file tells Godot how to load and interact with our compiled library.

**`godot_project/fbscript.gdextension`**
```ini
; fbscript.gdextension
; This file defines the GDExtension resource.

[configuration]
entry_symbol = "gdextension_entry" ; A placeholder, as we are not registering classes.
compatibility_minimum = "4.0"

[libraries]
; Paths to the compiled shared libraries for each platform.
windows.64 = "res://bin/libfbscript.dll"
linux.64 = "res://bin/libfbscript.so"
; macos.64 = "res://bin/libfbscript.dylib"
```

### 5. Use the Library in GDScript

Now, open the `godot_project` in the Godot editor. The `Main.tscn` scene has a script `Main.gd` attached. This script shows how to load the library and call the functions.

**`godot_project/Main.gd`**
```gdscript
# Main.gd
extends Node

# Path to the GDExtension resource file.
const FBSCRIPT_LIB_PATH = "res://fbscript.gdextension"

var fb_library

func _ready():
	print("Loading FreeBASIC library...")

	# Open the library using the GDExtension interface.
	fb_library = GDExtension.open_library(FBSCRIPT_LIB_PATH)

	if not fb_library:
		print("Error: Could not load the FreeBASIC library.")
		return

	# --- Call the 'add_integers' function ---
	# We call the function by the Alias name we defined in FreeBASIC.
	# The first argument is the function name.
	# The second argument is an array of the function's parameters.
	# The third argument (true) tells Godot to expect a return value.
	var sum = fb_library.call("fb_add_integers", [15, 27], true)
	print("FB says: 15 + 27 = ", sum) # Output: FB says: 15 + 27 = 42

	# --- Call the 'get_hello_message' function ---
	# This function returns a C-style string (char*).
	var message_ptr = fb_library.call("fb_get_hello_message", [], true)
	if message_ptr:
		# We need to convert the returned pointer to a Godot string.
		var message = Marshalls.ptr_to_str(message_ptr)
		print("FB says: ", message) # Output: FB says: Hello from FB!

	# Remember to close the library when you are done with it.
	# Typically, you would do this when the object is destroyed or the game closes.
	fb_library.close()
	print("FreeBASIC library closed.")

```

Run the Godot project (F5), and you will see the output from the FreeBASIC functions in the Godot console!

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Create a full wrapper to register FreeBASIC code as a native Godot `ClassDB` class.
-   [ ] Provide helper functions in FreeBASIC for easier interaction with Godot's core types (Vector2, String, Array).
-   [ ] Add examples for more complex data structures and callbacks.
-   [ ] Document advanced memory management techniques.
