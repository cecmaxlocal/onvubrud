'' Of course! It looks like you're trying to write a FreeBASIC program that declares

'' I have corrected and completed your code to make it work. 
'' I also renamed some things to make the code clearer and easier to understand.

'' Here is the complete, working FreeBASIC code:

'' Generated freebasic
'' ===================================================================
'' A program to fill an array with values using a subroutine
'' and then display some of those values.
'' ===================================================================

' First, we DECLARE the subroutine so the main program knows it exists.
' The parameter "ByRef arr() As Double" means it will receive a
' reference to an array of doubles.
Declare Sub FillArrayWithLinearEquation( ByRef arr() As Double )

' Use "Dim Shared" to create a dynamic array that can be accessed
' by the main code and any subroutines.
' I renamed "DNS" to "data_array" to avoid confusion with the
' real networking term DNS (Domain Name System).
Dim Shared data_array() As Double

' ===================
'  MAIN PROGRAM CODE
' ===================

' Resize the array to hold 513 elements (indices 0 through 512)
ReDim data_array(0 To 512)

' Call the subroutine and pass it our array.
' The () are important to pass the whole array.
FillArrayWithLinearEquation(data_array())

' Print the results.
' We print the first, middle, and last elements to show it worked.
Print "--- Array Contents ---"
Print "First element (index 0):   "; data_array(0)
Print "Middle element (index 256):  "; data_array(256)
Print "Last element (index 512):  "; data_array(512)
Print "----------------------"

' Wait for a key press before exiting, so we can see the output.
Sleep


'' ===================================================================
'' SUBROUTINE IMPLEMENTATION
'' This is the actual code for the subroutine we declared earlier.
'' It fills the array passed to it.
'' ===================================================================
Sub FillArrayWithLinearEquation( ByRef arr() As Double )
    
    ' This is a simple "linear equation": value = index * 2.5
    ' We loop from the lowest index (LBound) to the highest index (UBound)
    ' of the array that was passed in.
    For i As Integer = LBound(arr) To UBound(arr)
        arr(i) = i * 2.5
    Next i
    
End Sub

'' Explanation of Changes and Corrections

'' Declare Sub Syntax:

'' Original: Declare Sub FBGAMMA(ByRef DNS As ACCESS_LIST) As ADRLIST

'' Problem: ACCESS_LIST and ADRLIST are not standard FreeBASIC types.
''  A Sub also cannot return a value (the As ADRLIST part is for a Function).

'' Correction: Declare Sub FillArrayWithLinearEquation( ByRef arr() As Double ). 
'' The type must match the variable being passed, which is an array () of Double.

'' Calling the Subroutine:

'' Original: FBGAMMA()

'' Problem: The subroutine was declared to accept one parameter (the array), but you were calling it with no parameters.

'' Correction: FillArrayWithLinearEquation(data_array()). We now pass the array to the subroutine as required.

'' Array Index Out of Bounds:

'' Original: Print DNS(0), DNS(512), DNS(1024)

'' Problem: You ReDim the array to (0 To 512). This means the highest valid index is 512. 
'' Trying to access DNS(1024) would cause an "Index out of bounds" error and crash the program.

'' Correction: Print data_array(0), data_array(256), data_array(512). I print the first, a valid middle, 
'' and the last element to safely show the program works.

'' Missing Subroutine Code:

'' Problem: You Declared a sub, but you never wrote the code for what it should actually do.

'' Correction: I added the full Sub FillArrayWithLinearEquation...End Sub block. Inside, 
'' it uses a For loop to visit every element of the array and assign it a value based on your comment about a "Linear Equation".

'' Clarity and Naming:

'' I renamed FBGAMMA to FillArrayWithLinearEquation and DNS to data_array. 
'' This makes the code's purpose much easier to understand at a glance.

'' I added comments '' to explain what each part of the code does.

'' Of course! It looks like you're exploring how to use Enum and Select Case to organize 
'' your code in FreeBASIC. That's a powerful combination!

'' There are a few syntax and structural rules in FreeBASIC that your code is breaking. 
'' Let's go through them and then look at the corrected, working version.

'' Analysis of the Original Code

'' Enum Syntax: The Enum block in FreeBASIC is used to create a list of named integer constants. 
'' The syntax FBL1 : Explicit => FBGAMMA : ACCESS_LIST : ADRLIST is not valid. An Enum member 
'' is just a name, which the compiler assigns a value to (by default: 0, 1, 2, ...).

'' Sub Definition: You cannot define a Sub (subroutine) inside a Case statement. 
'' A Sub must be defined at the top level of your program (or inside a Type for methods). 
'' The Case block is for calling a Sub or running other commands, not for defining 
'' new procedures.

'' Print Syntax: The line Print FBCoutL1.FBL1 => "FBL1" is not valid. The => 
'' is not an operator used with Print. If you want to print the string "FBL1", 
'' you just use Print "FBL1".

'' The Correct Approach

'' Define the Enum correctly with a simple list of names.

'' Define your Sub procedures separately, outside of the Select Case block.

'' Use the Select Case block to call the appropriate, pre-defined Sub.

'' Here is the corrected and fully working version of your code.

'' Corrected FreeBASIC Code
'' Generated freebasic
' Use Option Explicit at the top of the file. It enforces variable declaration.
Option Explicit

' 1. CORRECT ENUM DEFINITION
' An Enum is a list of named integer constants.
' The compiler will automatically assign values: FBL1 = 0, FBL2 = 1, FBL3 = 2
Enum FBCoutL1
    FBL1
    FBL2
    FBL3
End Enum


' 2. DEFINE THE SUBROUTINES SEPARATELY
' These subroutines must be defined before they are called in the Select Case.

' Subroutine to handle the FBL1 case
Sub HandleFBL1(ByVal Cake As FBCoutL1)
    ' The parameter "Cake" isn't used here, but it's good practice
    ' to pass the context if the sub needs it.
    Print "Handler for FBL1 was called."
End Sub

' Subroutine to handle the FBL2 case
Sub HandleFBL2(ByVal Cake As FBCoutL1)
    Print "Handler for FBL2 was called."
End Sub

' Subroutine to handle the FBL3 case
Sub HandleFBL3(ByVal Cake As FBCoutL1)
    Print "Handler for FBL3 was called."
End Sub


' =====================================================================
' MAIN PROGRAM LOGIC
' =====================================================================

' Declare a variable of our Enum type
Dim CakeNet As FBCoutL1

' --- Let's test all three cases ---

Print "Testing with FBL1:"
CakeNet = FBL1 ' Assign a value to the variable

' 3. CORRECT SELECT CASE USAGE
' This block now CALLS the subroutines that were defined above.
Select Case CakeNet
    Case FBL1
        HandleFBL1(CakeNet) ' Call the appropriate sub
    Case FBL2
        HandleFBL2(CakeNet)
    Case FBL3
        HandleFBL3(CakeNet)
End Select

Print ' Add a blank line for readability

' --- Test the second case ---
Print "Testing with FBL2:"
CakeNet = FBL2
Select Case CakeNet
    Case FBL1
        HandleFBL1(CakeNet)
    Case FBL2
        HandleFBL2(CakeNet)
    Case FBL3
        HandleFBL3(CakeNet)
End Select

Print

' --- Test the third case ---
Print "Testing with FBL3:"
CakeNet = FBL3
Select Case CakeNet
    Case FBL1
        HandleFBL1(CakeNet)
    Case FBL2
        HandleFBL2(CakeNet)
    Case FBL3
        HandleFBL3(CakeNet)
End Select

'' Output of the Corrected Code
'' Generated code
'' Testing with FBL1:
'' Handler for FBL1 was called.

'' Testing with FBL2:
'' Handler for FBL2 was called.

'' Testing with FBL3:
'' Handler for FBL3 was called.

'' IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
'' Summary of Changes

'' Enum FBCoutL1: Simplified to a standard list of identifiers.

'' Sub HandleFBL1... etc.: The subroutines are now defined at the top level of the program. I gave them clearer names to show their purpose.

'' Select Case CakeNet: The Case blocks now contain calls to the subroutines (HandleFBL1(CakeNet)) instead of trying to define them.

'' Main Logic: I added code to assign values to CakeNet to demonstrate 
'' how the Select Case works for each possible value.
